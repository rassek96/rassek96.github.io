Heyo.<br>
My name is Rasmus Karlsson, I'm a 19 year old lad from Sweden. I grew up on the western side of Sweden, 
in the city of Halmstad where I lived until I turned 18. Now I live and study on the east side of the country, in Kalmar.<br>
My interests consists of webb developing and football, by that I mean watching football since I'm not very good at playing it.
The teams I support are Halmstad BK, who recently got relegated (again), and Manchester United of the English Premier League.
I've been to England several times to watch Manchester United play and I hope to move there and get a season ticket someday.
